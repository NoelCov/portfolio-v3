# Intro

Weâ€™ve all had interviews that we failed. You might even have been in that situation recently. I personally have in the past and I know it sucks. There are many reasons why we fail interviews, it could be that you didnâ€™t prepare, that the interviewer doesnâ€™t think you are the right fit for the company and maybe you lied in your CV, and they caught it. Whatever the reason is, I think this blog can help you. I wrote it based on personal experiences and also a Twitter Space I attended the other day, where many speakers shared their experiences. I will give credit to some of those speakers down below in the credits section, make sure to follow them since many of them create amazing valuable content.

## Get ready, prepare for the interview!

This point is pretty self-explanatory; youâ€™re not going to take a test without studying for it so why are you going to an interview not prepared? Interviews are similar, if you donâ€™t prepare some stories, some projects that you can talk about, if you donâ€™t prepare mentally, you might mess it up. But how do you get ready for an interview? I think it can be a bit tricky, it depends on what type of interview it is, depending on the position and the role. If you are for example, going for a manager position, prepare success stories, what have you done in the past that shows you are an amazing manager? If youâ€™re going for a Software Engineer interview, like I did recently, prepare some stories, companies love when you have experience working with others, Iâ€™ve never heard of a developer working alone. Also make sure your technical skills are on point, know your code, know your DSA, etc. A good way to practice for an interview is reading the job description you applied to. You can get a lot of information from it; does it say you require some leadership experience? Does it say you should know a specific programming language? Does it say you require x years of experience?

Going to an interview without being prepared will definitely lower your chances of passing it. Prepare for it!

## Do not lie about your experience. Theyâ€™ll find out if you did.

Iâ€™ve heard this one many times. Donâ€™t put yourself in this situation. Many companies do background checks, if the company youâ€™re interviewing with does, they will find out. If they donâ€™t do background checks, they can still find out during the interview because they will ask you about your work experience, theyâ€™ll ask you about the information you submitted when you applied and itâ€™s very hard to talk about something you didnâ€™t do, something you donâ€™t know anything about. Please do not do this, itâ€™ll damage you and your career and most likely, you will not pass the interview.

## Ask questions during the interview, clarify points, make sure you understand every question

Not asking questions and not understanding what itâ€™s being asked by the interviewer can make you say something not appropriate or just make the situation awkward if you stay quiet because you donâ€™t know what the recruiter said. Make sure youâ€™re clarifying every question. Also, remember, the interview is for both the company to know if theyâ€™ll give you the job but also for YOU to see if you really want to get that job. If you donâ€™t ask questions about the work culture, vacations, location, remote, etc. You are not going to know anything about the job and trust me, Iâ€™ve heard many people end up regretting not asking questions because they find out at the last minute that the job is not remote when they thought it was. Something itâ€™s helped me in this situation is to have some pre-written questions, so that I donâ€™t forget what to ask. This goes back to the first point I talked about, **prepare for the interview.**

## Explain your thought process

This does not apply for every type of interview. This is mostly for programmers and roles that require problem solving skills. Explaining what youâ€™re thinking can only help the interviewer know how you solve problems, which, at least for programming, is VERY important. Iâ€™ve always been the type to talk to myself, I usually learn things better if I think out loud, so Iâ€™m used to it. If youâ€™ve never done it, if you arenâ€™t used to explain something while you do it. Start practicing because itâ€™s important. A tech recruiter said that he has done countless of interviews where the person sitting across the room is just looking down trying to solve the problem, and in that situation, he said itâ€™s very hard for him to help the interviewee. Do not put yourself in that situation, the interviewer will most likely want to help you, they might give you some hints, some tips, they might even straight up tell you youâ€™re doing it wrong. Let them help you.

## Put yourself in a good situation

What does this mean you might ask? Well, it means that you are not going to go to an interview you know you wonâ€™t pass, it means that you are going to get prepared, instead of going to an interview not knowing what to expect. In tech, for Software Engineers at least, many companies ask Algorithms and Data Structures, which many people do not like. If you are part of that group, my recommendation is to not put yourself in a situation where youâ€™ll be asked 3-4 algorithm questions. Instead, apply for a company in which the interview focuses on other things, thatâ€™s what putting yourself in a good situation means. Be smart about your time and your energy.
